# Favicon Implementation for JK Appliances

## Overview
This document explains the favicon implementation for the JK Appliances website to ensure proper display in Google search results and across various devices.

## Files Created/Modified

### Favicon Files
- `favicon.ico` - Traditional favicon file (already existed)
- `favicon.svg` - Vector version for modern browsers
- `apple-icon.webp` - Icon for Apple devices
- `android-chrome-192x192.png` - Icon for Android devices
- `android-chrome-512x512.png` - Larger icon for Android devices
- `site.webmanifest` - Web app manifest file for PWA support

### Configuration
The favicon configuration has been added to:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added proper metadata and link tags

## How It Works

1. **Multiple Icon Formats**: We've provided icons in various formats to ensure compatibility across all devices and browsers.

2. **Web App Manifest**: The `site.webmanifest` file provides information about the web application when installed on a device.

3. **Metadata Configuration**: The Next.js metadata configuration in `layout.tsx` includes all necessary icon references.

4. **Direct Link Tags**: Additional link tags in the head section ensure maximum compatibility.

## Google Search Results

With these changes, Google search results should now display your favicon properly. The process may take some time as Google needs to recrawl your site to recognize the new favicon configuration.

## Future Improvements

For better branding, consider replacing the placeholder SVG icons with professionally designed icons that match your brand identity.
